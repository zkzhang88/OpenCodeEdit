SYSTEM_PROMPT_V5_1 = """You are an experienced programmer who is skilled at creating high-quality program editing tasks and providing precise solutions."""
USER_PROMPT_V5_1_ROUND_1 = """
Please gain inspiration from the following two code snippets and design a Python program. Then, create a task to edit the program. \
Please output the Python program first, and then output the editing task in both descriptive and lazy forms. \
Present your output in three distinct sections [Program Before Edit] [Descriptive] and [Lazy]. 

Requirements for the program: 

- The program should be completed, with all necessary library function imports.

Requirements for the program editing task: 

- The types of editing tasks can be **diverse**, such as *fixing errors*, *enhancing existing features*, *meeting new requirements*, and so on.
- Ensure that the task can be completed in a single file.

## Code Snippet 1:

{code_snippet_1}

## Code Snippet 2:

{code_snippet_2}

## Guidelines for each section:

1. [Program Before Edit]: A new program inspired by the two code snippets. The program can be faulty, as we can repair it in the editing task.
2. [Descriptive]: Offer a **detailed** instruction. This should be **completely self-contained**, providing all the contextual information \
one needs to understand and solve the task. Ensure that any specific context, variables, or code snippets pertinent to this problem \
are explicitly included, but the program after editing is not allowed to appear in the instruction.
3. [Lazy]: Offer a **simple but clear** instruction. You should describe the task in no more than three sentences, \
but the description should be clear to understand by humans.

**Here is an example for the program to be generated and the description of the editing task:**
[Program Before Edit]
```
{code_before_shot}
```

[Descriptive]
{desc_instr_shot}

[Lazy]
{lazy_instr_shot}

Is the program you designed in section [Program Before Edit] reasonable? \
If it is reasonable, Please provide the revised standard code based on the task you designed, in the section [Program After Edit], without any explanation;\
if it is unreasonable, please only output a mark <UNREASONABLE> without any code or explanation.
